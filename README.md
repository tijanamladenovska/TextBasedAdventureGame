**Project Introduction**

This is a multi-player text adventure game where players explore interconnected environments, solve puzzles, interact with objects, and collaborate or compete with each other.
A rich narrative across 4 chapters with distinct settings
- Time-travel elements and magical realism
- Multiple endings based on player choices
- Both single-player and multiplayer modes

**Technical Implementation**
The game is built in Java using several key software engineering principles:

**Core Architecture:**
- Object-oriented design with clear separation of concerns
- Modular chapter system (Chapter1Room, Chapter2Marketplace, etc.)
- Observer pattern for game state notifications

**Key Components:**
- GameState singleton manages global state
- Room and Item classes form the game world
- CommandParser handles player input
- GameServer/GameClient enable multiplayer

**Design Patterns:**
- Singleton: For global game state management
- Observer: Notify players of changes
- Factory: Create rooms and items
- Command: Process player actions

**Gameplay Flow**
- Players start in Chapter 1, learning basic mechanics
- Progress through chapters by solving puzzles and making choices
- Collect items that affect stats (health, stamina)
- Face increasingly complex challenges
- Reach one of multiple endings based on final choices

**This project demonstrates:**
- Good OOP principles in practice
- Effective use of design patterns
- Clean code organization
- Game development fundamentals

**Technical Challenges Addressed**
- State Management: Solved via Singleton pattern
- Multiplayer Sync: Handled through observer pattern
- Extensibility: Modular chapter system allows easy expansion
- Input Handling: Robust command parser system

**Unique Value**
- Combines traditional text adventure with modern multiplayer
- Implements time-travel mechanics in a cohesive way
- Offers meaningful player choices affecting outcomes
- Demonstrates how to structure a complex Java project
